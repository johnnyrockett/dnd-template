</div>
<div class=tab>
    <details><summary>Sneak Attack</summary>
    Beginning at 1st Level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an Attack if you have advantage on the Attack roll. The Attack must use a Finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the Attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't Incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the Attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

    <details><Summary>Thieves' Cant</summary>
    During your rogue Training you learned thieves' cant, a Secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a Message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of Secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a Safe House for thieves on the run.

## Magic

### Special
<div class=tab>
    <details><summary>Breath Weapon<input type="checkbox"></summary>
You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. 5 by 30 ft. line of acid (Dex. save)

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a dex saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you canâ€™t use it again until you complete a short or Long Rest.
