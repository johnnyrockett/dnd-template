## Magic

### Special
<div class=tab>
    <details><summary>Bardic Inspiration<input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"></summary>
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a Bonus Action on Your Turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, Attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls The D20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th Level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Cantrips

<div class=tab>
    <details><summary>Grum's Fix 'em/Hurt 'em</summary>
    Casting time: 	1 action
Range: 	Touch
Components: 	V, S, Drop of blood smeared on target
Duration: 	Instantaneous


You make a melee spell attack against your target, unless the target is willing and stationary, or incapacitated.

On a hit, you choose to heal the target, or damage the target for 1d4+1 necrotic.

If target is undead, add +1 damage per d4 cast (so +1 until 10th level, +2 at 11th level and +4 at 17th level, in addition to any extra d4s added due to casting at higher levels). The spell has no effect on non-flesh constructs.

If healing a target, the caster takes damage equal to the amount healed. The caster cannot heal more Hit Points than they currently have, but by healing the caster can bring themselves down to 0 HP.

If damaging a target, the caster is healed an amount equal to the damage dealt, up to but not above the caster's maximum HP. If the damage is more than the caster's maximum HP, further damage to the target is halved.

The spell's effect increases when the caster's total levels (all classes) reach 5th, 11th and 17th. At 5th level the spell heals or harms for (1d4+1), at 11th level it is (2d4+1), and at 17th level the spell heals and/or harms for (4d4+1).

<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Magnetize</summary>
Casting time: 	1 action
Range: 	15 foot cone
Components: 	V, S
Duration: 	Instantaneous


As an action, you magnetize all metal in front of you in a 15 foot cone. Items containing metal that weigh 15 pounds or less become magnetized. As part of the action you can choose whether throw the metal in any direction up to 15 feet, crush it into a center, or expel it outwards in a circle. Creatures in the way must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage. Once the metal is moved it is no longer magnetized.

<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Soul Gem</summary>
Casting time: 	1 Bonus Action
Range: 	120 feet
Components: 	V (you must say the type of gem you wish the soul to be captured in)
Duration: 	10 minute


You choose a creature that you can see within range and mark it with dark energy, ensnaring the spiritual essence of their soul. If the creature dies within the spell's duration, the creature's soul is captured in a gem that materializes and is magically affixed to anything on your person.

The gem looks identical to a real gem in every way. However, a perception check contested against your spell save DC reveals that the gem is fake and has no monetary value. The soul inside can only be detected by magical means. The soul gem also cannot be used as material in lieu of an real gem in casting a spell.

The gem cannot be removed from its location by anyone except you by any means. You may choose to use an action to relocate the gem to a different item on your person.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can capture one additional creatures soul for each slot level above 1st.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
