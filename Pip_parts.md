## Magic

### Cantips
<div class=tab>
    <details><summary>Mending</summary>
    This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Thunderclap</summary>
    You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Each creature within range, other than you, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage.
    The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
    </details>
    <details><summary>Spare the Dying</summary>
    You use your action to touch a creature who is alive but at 0 hit points. It becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead and constructs.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Minor Illusion</summary>
You create a sound or an image of an object that lasts for the duration. The illusion ends early if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, it can be any volume and noise. The sound can continue unabated for the duration, or you can make sounds at different times.

If you create an image of an object, it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create any sensory effects. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion.

A creature can use its action to make an Investigation check on the illusion. If it succeeds, the illusion becomes faint to it.

### 1st Level  <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox">
<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Healing Word</summary>
A creature you can see regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
</details>

<details><summary>Cure Wounds</summary>
A creature you touch regains a number of Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your Spellcasting Ability modifier. This spell has no effect on Undead or constructs.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
</details>

<details><summary>Disguise Self</summary>
You make yourself, including your clothing, armor, Weapons, and other belongings on your person, look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the Illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, Objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
</details>

<details><summary>Hideous Laughter</summary>
A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laugher if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming Incapacitated and unable to stand up for the Duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.
</details>

<details><summary>Unseen Servant</summary>
This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your Command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't Attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally Command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, Mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the Command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next Command.

If you Command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

### 2nd Level  <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox">
<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Hold Person</summary>
A humanoid that you can see becomes paralyzed unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. At the end of its turns, it can make another Wisdom save, ending the paralysis on a success.
</details>
<details><summary>Invisibility</summary>
A creature you touch becomes Invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is Invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
</details>
<details><summary>Darkness</summary>
Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot radius sphere for the duration.
The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
</details>
<details><summary>Mind Spike</summary>
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.
