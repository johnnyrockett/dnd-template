## Magic

### Special
<div class=tab>
    <details><summary>Bardic Inspiration<input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"></summary>
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Song of Rest</summary>
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Font of Inspiration</summary>
Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

### Cantips
<div class=tab>
    <details><summary>Mending</summary>
    This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Thunderclap</summary>
    You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Each creature within range, other than you, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage.
    The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
    </details>
    <details><summary>Spare the Dying</summary>
    You use your action to touch a creature who is alive but at 0 hit points. It becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead and constructs.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Minor Illusion</summary>
You create a sound or an image of an object that lasts for the duration. The illusion ends early if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, it can be any volume and noise. The sound can continue unabated for the duration, or you can make sounds at different times.

If you create an image of an object, it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create any sensory effects. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion.

A creature can use its action to make an Investigation check on the illusion. If it succeeds, the illusion becomes faint to it.

### 1st Level  <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox">
<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Healing Word</summary>
A creature you can see regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
</details>

<details><summary>Cure Wounds</summary>
A creature you touch regains a number of Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your Spellcasting Ability modifier. This spell has no effect on Undead or constructs.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
</details>

<details><summary>Disguise Self</summary>
You make yourself, including your clothing, armor, Weapons, and other belongings on your person, look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the Illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, Objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
</details>

<details><summary>Hideous Laughter</summary>
A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laugher if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming Incapacitated and unable to stand up for the Duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.
</details>

<details><summary>Unseen Servant</summary>
This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your Command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't Attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally Command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, Mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the Command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next Command.

If you Command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.
</details>

### 2nd Level  <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox">
<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Hold Person</summary>
A humanoid that you can see becomes paralyzed unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. At the end of its turns, it can make another Wisdom save, ending the paralysis on a success.
</details>
<details><summary>Invisibility</summary>
A creature you touch becomes Invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is Invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
</details>
<details><summary>See Invisibility</summary>
For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.
</details>
<details><summary>Mind Spike</summary>
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.
</details>
</div>

### 3nd Level  <input type="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox">
<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Lightning Bolt</summary>
A stroke of lightning forming a line of 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 3rd.
</details>
</div>
<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Sending</summary>
You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.
You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.
</details>
</div>
<div class=tab>
<details><summary>Mass healing Word</summary>
As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Range 60 ft.
